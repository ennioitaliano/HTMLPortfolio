# HTML Portfolio
Minimal portfolio website written in pure HTML/CSS to keep things simple.

You can see the website at [ennioitaliano.github.io/html-portfolio](https://ennioitaliano.github.io/html-portfolio).

The [Angular version](https://github.com/ennioitaliano/angular-portfolio) of this website (visually identical to the HTML one) can be viewed at [ennioitaliano.github.io](https://ennioitaliano.github.io)

I've build this website with a 'learning-by-doing' approach, and it has been very useful. I've learned how to deal with flex-box and grid, and got a first contact with media queries for dark mode and responsiveness; I've also used some JavaScript to switch between styles.

~The responiveness is far from perfect since I only managed desktop and mobile screens (with one single breakpoint at 768px and flex-box wrapping doing the rest of the work), accessibility is near inexistent and~ dark mode can be improved ~a lot~, but I decided to stop the developement here to focus on other projects (where I will apply these more advanced concepts).

Hope this can inspire you to start doing something (maybe this could be your first project ;)).
